# MARL Resources Collection
This is a collection of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) Resources. The purpose of this repository is to give beginners a better understanding of MARL and accelerate the learning process. Note that some of the resources are written in Chinese and only important papers that have a lot of citations were listed. 

I will continually update this repository and I welcome suggestions. (missing important papers, missing important resources, invalid links, etc.) This is only a first draft so far and I'll add more resources in the next few months.

This repository is not for commercial purposes.

## Open Source Environments
* StarCraft Micromanagement Environment
   * [pymarl](https://github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl) This is the original environment mentioned in the paper [The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04043). Note that pymarl is based on [SMAC](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac).
   * [link](https://github.com/starry-sky6688/StarCraft) This is a simplified implementation of [pymarl](https://github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl)
